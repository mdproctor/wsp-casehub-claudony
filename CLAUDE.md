# claudony Workspace

**Name:** casehub-claudony
**Project repo:** proj/
**Workspace type:** public

## Session Start


## Artifact Locations

| Skill | Writes to |
|-------|-----------|
| brainstorming (specs) | `specs/` |
| writing-plans (plans) | `plans/` |
| handover | `HANDOFF.md` |
| idea-log | `IDEAS.md` |
| design-snapshot | `snapshots/` |
| java-update-design / update-primary-doc | `design/JOURNAL.md` (created by `epic`) |
| adr | `adr/` |
| write-blog | `~/claude/mdproctor.github.io/` (via publish-blog — not staged in workspace) |

## Structure

- `HANDOFF.md` — session handover (single file, overwritten each session)
- `IDEAS.md` — idea log (single file)
- `specs/` — brainstorming / design specs (superpowers output)
- `plans/` — implementation plans (superpowers output)
- `snapshots/` — design snapshots with INDEX.md (auto-pruned, max 10)
- `adr/` — architecture decision records with INDEX.md
- `design/` — epic journal (created by `epic` at branch start)

## Git Discipline

Two git repositories are active in every session: a **workspace** (methodology artifacts: handover, blog, specs, plans, ADRs) and the **project repo** (source code).

Before any git operation, run `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` to confirm which repo is currently active. Do not assume — the session may have opened in either. cd to the correct repo before staging:
- Source code commits → project repo
- Methodology artifacts → workspace

## Git Workflow

origin   → casehubio/claudony (repo transferred 2026-06-04; fork distinction no longer applies)

Before starting any branch: `git fetch origin && git rebase origin/main` to sync local main. At work-end: rebase the branch onto local main, push to `origin main`. PRs are created on demand — never automatically at work-end.

## Rules

- All methodology artifacts go here, not in the project repo
- Promotion to project repo is always explicit — never automatic
- Workspace branches mirror project branches — switch both together

## Routing

| Artifact   | Destination | Notes |
|------------|-------------|-------|
| adr        | project     | lands in `docs/adr/` — promoted at epic close |
| specs      | project     | lands in `docs/specs/` — promoted at epic close |
| blog       | project                 | staged here; published via publish-blog (destination in ~/.claude/blog-routing.yaml) |
| plans      | workspace   | stay in workspace permanently |
| design     | project     | journal file lives in workspace design/; DESIGN.md merge target is project docs/DESIGN.md |
| snapshots  | workspace   | stay in workspace permanently |
| handover   | workspace   | |
